   <h1>College Tuition Costs are Rising</h1>
   <p>So I wrote this paper for my comp class and it was for one of our five projects.  The next project of the term was to <span>remix</span> (to combine or edit exisitng materials to produce something new) one of our previous projects and so I chose to take the information from that paper and present in a website along with a website that just has stuff about me and stuff.  So yeah. :P  If you would like to view <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f_TXLhKuTp6mruWOxSu7uo4DwMxNTdszOa-DQ93DJ0/pub">my paper</a> just click on it.</p>
